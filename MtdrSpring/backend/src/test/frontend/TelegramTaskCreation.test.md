**System and/or Component Test:** Component Test
**Status:** Not-Tested

### Test Data:

```json
{
  "newTask": {
    "title": "Implement user authentication",
    "description": "Add OAuth2 authentication flow",
    "priority": "High",
    "category": "Backend",
    "status": "To Do",
    "estimateHours": 16,
    "realHours": 0,
    "deadline": "2024-02-28T23:59:59Z",
    "assignedTo": {
      "firstName": "Jane",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "role": "Developer"
    }
  }
}
```

### Acceptance Criteria:

#### Description of Expected Result:

Given that I am a developer with permissions to create tasks
When I use the command to create a new task in Telegram
Then I should be able to input all required task details through a guided process
And the system should create the task with the provided information
And I should receive a confirmation message with the created task details

### Expected Output Data:

```json
{
  "confirmationMessage": {
    "message": "Task created successfully!",
    "taskDetails": {
      "title": "Implement user authentication",
      "description": "Add OAuth2 authentication flow",
      "priority": "High",
      "category": "Backend",
      "status": "To Do",
      "estimateHours": 16,
      "realHours": 0,
      "deadline": "2024-02-28T23:59:59Z",
      "assignedTo": {
        "firstName": "Jane",
        "lastName": "Smith",
        "role": "Developer"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The creation process should support:

1. Task title and description
2. Priority selection
3. Category assignment
4. Status setting
5. Time estimation
6. Deadline setting
7. Developer assignment

#### Evidence of Expected Result:

[Placeholder for Telegram bot conversation flow screenshots showing:

1. Task creation command initiation
2. Step-by-step input process
3. Final confirmation message with task details]

### Observations or Notes:

1. The task creation process should be step-by-step to avoid overwhelming users
2. Each input should be validated before proceeding to the next step
3. Users should be able to cancel the creation process at any point
4. The bot should provide clear instructions for each required input
5. Date and time inputs should follow a specific format
6. The process should handle error cases gracefully
7. Developer assignment should be done through a list of available team members
