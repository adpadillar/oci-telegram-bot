### Acceptance Criteria:

#### Description of Expected Result:

Given that I am a user with access to sprint information
When I request to view sprints using the Telegram bot
Then I should see a list of all available sprints
And each sprint should display:

- Sprint name
- Date range
- Status
- Number of tasks
  And when I click on a sprint's tasks button
  Then I should see a detailed list of all tasks associated with that sprint

#### Evidence of Expected Result:

[Placeholder for Telegram bot screenshots showing:

1. List of sprints with basic information
2. Interactive buttons for each sprint
3. Expanded view of tasks when a sprint is selected]

### Observations or Notes:

1. The sprint list should be organized chronologically
2. Active sprints should be highlighted or marked distinctively
3. Task list should be paginated if there are many tasks
4. Tasks should display their current status clearly
5. The interface should provide easy navigation between sprints
6. Consider adding filters for tasks within a sprint
7. Sprint status should be clearly visible (active, completed, planned)
