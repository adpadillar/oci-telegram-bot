  ]
}
```

### Acceptance Criteria:

#### Description of Expected Result:

Given that I am a developer
When I interact with the Telegram bot using the command to view my tasks
Then I should see a list of all tasks assigned to me
And each task should display:

- Task ID
- Description
- Current status
- Estimated hours
- Category (if available)

#### Evidence of Expected Result:

### Observations or Notes:

1. The task list should be formatted in a readable way within Telegram's message constraints
2. Long task descriptions should be truncated appropriately
3. The command to view tasks should be intuitive (e.g., /mytasks or /tasks)
4. Tasks should be ordered by priority or deadline if applicable
5. The response should handle scenarios where no tasks are assigned
