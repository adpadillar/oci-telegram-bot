**Requirement ID:** RF-008
**Test ID:** RF-T008
**System and/or Component Test:** System Test
**Status:** Not-Tested

### Test Data:

```json
{
  "sprints": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Sprint 1 - Q1 2024",
      "startDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "endDate": "2024-01-15T23:59:59Z",
      "status": "active",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "id": 101,
          "description": "Implement user authentication",
          "status": "in-progress",
          "estimateHours": 8,
          "category": "feature",
          "assignedTo": {
            "firstName": "John",
            "lastName": "Doe"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Endpoints:

- `GET /api/sprints` - Retrieves the list of all sprints
- `GET /api/sprints/{id}` - Retrieves details of a specific sprint by ID
- `GET /api/sprints/{id}/tasks` - Retrieves the list of tasks for a specific sprint by

### Acceptance Criteria:

#### Description of Expected Result:

Given that I am a project manager or developer
When I navigate to the sprints view in the web application
Then I should see a list of all available sprints displayed in a table or card format
And each sprint should display:

- Sprint name
- Date range
- Status
- Number of tasks
  And when I click the "View Tasks" button on a sprint
  Then I should see an expanded view or modal with all tasks associated with that sprint

#### Evidence of Expected Result:

[Placeholder for web application screenshots showing:

1. Sprint list view with all sprints displayed
2. Task list view when a sprint's "View Tasks" button is clicked
3. Visual indication of sprint status (active/completed/planned)]

### Observations or Notes:

1. The sprint list should support sorting by date or status
2. Consider implementing filters for viewing specific sprint statuses
3. Task list should be paginated if there are many tasks
4. Consider implementing a search function for tasks within a sprint
5. The interface should provide clear visual feedback when loading data
6. Sprint cards/rows should have consistent height and spacing
7. Consider adding a sprint progress indicator (% of completed tasks)
8. The view should be responsive and work well on different screen sizes
